# NodeSchool Kyiv ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

NodeSchool is a series of open source [workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/) that
teach web software skills.

NodeSchool meetups like NodeSchoolKyiv provide a space for people to do the
workshoppers on their own or with others. The workshopper tutorials are used as
the course curriculum, while mentors are here to help attendees work through
challenges. Learn more [here](http://nodeschool.io/kyiv/).
